<h1 align="center">Enoki / Jacinto</h1>

Truly the most basic design. An example of how to load a site’s content and problematically display whatever content is available, regardless of what fields are available.

Consider it a boilerplate instead of a reference to study. Takes these ideas with you to use from memory in the future.

Includes [Choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo) as a front-end framework, and [Sheetify](https://github.com/stackcss/sheetify) for css-in-js.

## Customization

If you created your site from the Enoki Panel, `cd` to the `source` directory and run `npm install`. Once the dependencies are installed, run `npm start` for development and `npm run build` for bundling.

To stay up to date, clone the [repository](https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki-design-vacany) and `git pull origin master` changes.
