## 📚✨ Datreads: Goodreads but good!
### Keep track of the books that you've been reading and share them with your book-loving friends!

Clone it, add it to your library in Beaker, and start adding your very own books via the [Enoki Panel](dat://panel.enoki.site). Wow! Includes [Choo 🚂](https://github.com/choojs/choo) as a front-end framework, and [Sheetify](https://github.com/stackcss/sheetify) for css-in-js.

#### Current Datreads features:
- Look at all of your books in a big nice grid!
- At _least_ 90% less visual elements on the page than on almost any Goodreads page
- See your books on a yearly timeline, which is sort of fun! What were you reading while the world was in various states of disarray? What did you read super fast, like it was a book snack? What did you slog through _f o r e v e r_?
- Jeff Bezos doesn't know what you're reading 💯

#### Future features:
- save books that you'd like to read but haven't yet
- display books by year 
- sort books by title, author, or date read
- display notes/reviews
- a more interactive timeline (show books on hover! sort! color code it! embed it elsewhere?)
- smarter tags

#### Development
From the project root, run `yarn install`. Once the dependencies are installed, run `yarn run dev` for development and `yarn run build` to bundle. Add it to your library in Beaker and then add books via the [Enoki Panel](dat://panel.enoki.site), or manually in `/content/books`.
