    "text": "Since 1965, British artist [Stephen Willats](http://stephenwillats.com/) has self-published _Control_ magazine, a seminal forum for artists’ writings on art practice and social organization. With over 150 contributors throughout its 50-year run, _Control_ has drawn on research from cybernetics, advertising theory, and behavioral science to develop models for how artworks operate in dialogue with an audience and society at large. Last year Willats published the 20th issue of _Control_, in which he continues to pose incisive questions about the ethics of information systems and networked artistic practice that feel more crucial than ever.\n\nCybernetics was famously defined by Norbert Wiener as “the scientific study of communication and control in the animal and the machine.” The models of feedback that cyberneticians developed were transdisciplinary from the outset, bridging the worlds of computation and engineering with those of design, art, and counterculture.\n\n![](dat://2294f8789a7dac7028c2aaebd47d287b148f45ad35ba697eb80a505066420a40/content/entries/another-one/fig_1.png)\n\nAccording to [Anthony Hudek](http://www.ravenrow.org/texts/55/), “It is … _Control_’s function as a self-determining information network, instead of its content, that makes it truly cybernetic”: while being about networks, the magazine also represents a network in itself. Willats’ choice of title, _Control_, signals this departure from traditional models of editorial authority, seeking instead to develop a conceptual practice determined by the networked relationships of coordinating agents. Artists’ publishing served as a key means of actualizing these ideas. The magazine has always been self-published, self-funded, and free of advertising, while also attaining a broadly international reach.\n\nThe interview that follows focuses specifically on _Control_’s early years, notable for their iconic cover illustrations by designer Dean Bradley. Released between 1965 and 1970, _Control_’s first issues mark a period when cybernetic ideas resonated broadly within the visual arts, from Jasia Reichardt’s 1968 Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition at the ICA London, to Stewart Brand’s Whole Earth Catalog in California. Willats’ own practice deployed the frameworks that he and his collaborators devised across _Control_’s pages in a variety of ways, from computer simulations to social and educational projects such as the Centre for Behavioral Art (1972-73). _Control_ is not only a key node within Willats’ body of work; it offers a fascinating toolkit for reconsidering the present status of social hierarchy and networked interaction.",

    "text": "The other thing that I got involved in was educational programs. Education was a great means of developing ideas. Working with a group of students you could develop in a free environment where you could create really radical ideas and models. I was lucky, I got a whole year with a group of students and I created this course where there was no difference between staff and students and all the work was cooperative and collaborative. There was no individual competitive work. Out of that, I remember there was no way in which we could discuss these ideas and externalize them to other artists or anybody like that. We had the feeling that we were going to places that nobody had ever been before, and yet we had no way of externalizing this to other artists and establishing those philosophical models.\n\nThat’s really how _Control_ came about. It was through that need, but it was also part of this idea of the Conceptual Designer. If you look at the first issue of _Control_ it was really an artwork, it wasn’t seen as a magazine. You’ve got a purple spot on the cover and a purple spot on the inside. The idea was that you took the purple spot inside, pinned it on the wall, put a chair underneath it and sat there with the magazine, so there was a connection between the two purple spots, the one on the inside of the magazine, which you put on the wall, and the one on the cover of the magazine. It was a kind of philosophical idea.\n\n![](dat://2294f8789a7dac7028c2aaebd47d287b148f45ad35ba697eb80a505066420a40/content/entries/kind-of-between/coreee_design.png)\n\nWe had all sorts of names that we were thinking of for the magazine, but in the end, I settled on _Control_ because, for one it’s a polemical word, and it’s pivotal in denoting different models of society. For instance, the common idea of control is of a hierarchical, top-down deterministic system, like you might get in the military or something like that. Our society is more or less like that here, but there are other models of control. The control that we were interested in was the idea of self-organizing, homeostatic, one-layer systems. The idea of networks between people. In a way we were entering, shall we say, free flowing, totally flexible models of relationships really, which has got us into a lot of trouble, but anyway…",

    "text": "Sarah Hamerman: Could you briefly introduce your thinking about the relationship between cybernetics and _Control_ magazine?\n\nStephen Willats: _Control_ magazine came about from a particular period of my life in the middle sixties, when I was trying to develop new paradigms for art practice which seemed connected to the world that was emerging. At that time, there was an exciting feeling, that the world we were in was moving forward, becoming more liberated and more socially self-responsible. It was a rejection of the idea of determinism. The early 1950s was still characterized by determinist thinking, but in the late ‘50s people began to develop other models that established many aspects of the world we live in today. The idea of fluidity, the idea of complexity, the idea of relativity, the idea of randomness, and entropy. But what was interesting at that moment was the notion that the world isn’t simple, as presumed in a reductive sort of society, an object-based society of property and possessions, where the self is treated as an object. This is a kind of reductist view, and was associated with competitive modes of behavior. There was emerging this idea that the world was actually complex, and within the complexity of the world there were more variables, more richness, more possibilities to develop new paradigms for society.\n\nAmongst all that was the idea that we needed new tools to create a dynamic picture of this new world, we needed tools to model it. And cybernetics was a modelling tool. It was a means of creating philosophical reductist pictures of a world that didn’t yet exist. It can be descriptive, in that it can describe what’s there, but it can also describe what’s possible. In that time, especially in Europe, there was a legacy that had been handed down to us, which put you in a box. In fact, it was kind of claustrophobic. That box was called the artist and the gallery. Pictures hung on walls and you stood in front of them, to put it crudely. It was a transmission situation that functioned a bit like a radio. If you think of the radio, I always think of the radio as last-century thinking. It comes out of the 19th century idea of transmission. There’s a transmitter and there’s a receiver, and in the traditional modus operandi of the artist and the picture, that’s the same modus operandi, really. In contemporary life—it wasn’t true 500 or 600 years ago, but that’s what it had become. We felt that we were in a straitjacket.\n\nSo I decided to kind of go back to zero to rethink the whole thing, and I stopped calling myself an artist. I had to find a new name for this this new creative person in this new society. At that point we were thinking laterally all the time. We were making lateral connections between other disciplines and other specializations. Hierarchical societies’ use knowledge as a means of power rather than an elevative mechanism. We wanted to break that all down. We were talking about one-layer networks, the idea that information was completely available through a network.\n\n![](dat://2294f8789a7dac7028c2aaebd47d287b148f45ad35ba697eb80a505066420a40/content/entries/super/control_5.png)\n\nLike a floating baseline—everytime a node in the network received information, there was complete coupling to all other nodes…\n\nSo I stopped calling myself an artist. I wanted to look at all means of communication within society to take what I could from everywhere I could, and reformulate it into a new way of operating. I needed a new title for myself, so I called myself a Conceptual Designer. As a Conceptual Designer I did various things. One of them you might know about, I developed _Multiple Clothing_. I wanted to intervene in the fabric of society directly. Not just sit inside a box, but to move freely within the interpersonal infrastructure of society. To create the means of people transforming their own sense of reality and identity and vision of the future. I also made self-organizing furniture.",
